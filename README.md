# NoxEngine
This was a group project effort as part of a masters degree in computer graphics and games engineering at the University of Leeds.
This engine is made from the ground up by using a few different libraries and has the following features:

- Asset importing from multiple different file formats using the AssImp library
- 3D audio engine with audio occulusion and audio effects.
- Fullscreen shaders & post processing
- Scripting using Lua.
- Live File Reloading for almost all the files including scripts, shaders, skybox images and can be extended further too.
- Framebased animation and animation editing.

## Getting started

The engine is easy to compile, it uses git submodules to handle 3rd Party libraries and uses Premake to generate build systems.
All you need is grab the source code, grab the submodules and run premake.

Currently only Windows is supported.
